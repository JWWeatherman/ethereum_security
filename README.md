# Etherium Threat Model
### A cursory security review of the Ethereum cryptocurrency

---

# Motivation
The Ethereum cryptocurrency is one of the largest cryptocurrencies. 
As of this writing (Q1 2018) it has a market cap in the billions.

# Conclusion
The Ethereum project doesn’t currently justify 
a thorough security review because the security design flaws 
are so glaring and fundamental that even a brief overview 
of the major issues is sufficient to demonstrate 
the projects general insecurity and 
inability to achieve the expectation of users.

A more thorough analysis will be justified 
if these issues are significantly resolved.

However, it should be noted that design level 
security flaws often require a completely new 
design and it is unlikely that 
that the Ethereum project can be salvaged 
more cheaply than starting from scratch.

# Findings Summary
* Although Ethereum claims to be a “world supercomputer” 
the features envisioned here 
need to be build on top of the digital asset that functions as money.
* As a result Ethereum must be the most secure digital asset to be viable. 
This is beacuse only the most secure digital will be selected by the market
as money (often callend "sound money" by economists). 
* Ethereum has no cap on the total number of assets it will produce.
* Ethereum is not sufficiently secure 
to prevent unpopular transactions from being reversed. 
This has happened on more than one occasion.
* The code used to create even the most basic contracts is so complex 
that it has proven to be impractical to create trustworthy code.
* Ethereum is at a disadvantage to bitcoin 
because it has a shorter price history and market cap.
* The developers working on Ethereum are inferior 
in quality and quantity to those working on bitcoin.
* The Ethereum difficulty adjustment, that affects both the security of transactions 
and the emission rate of new tokens, is manually adjusted by one person.
